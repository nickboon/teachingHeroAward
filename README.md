The teaching hero award initiative enables students from across the higher education sector in Ireland to recognise those teachers who have had a strong and lasting impact on their learning and on their lives. The award will be an endorsement of outstanding teachers and a celebration of the value of higher education teaching. This is your chance to be the student who designs the signature piece and define how the prize should look. We are looking for a design that will capture the spirit of the award: the dedication, inspiration and care that great teachers display.

We invite you to submit a design proposal for the award pieceâ€š which will be presented to up to 70 teaching heroes of higher education at a ceremony in September 2014.
